## Overview

The **Attendance Management System** is a modern solution designed to automate and simplify the process of tracking attendance. It eliminates the need for traditional manual attendance methods by utilizing advanced technologies like **QR codes**, **facial recognition**, and a **Java-MySQL** backend for real-time monitoring and accurate reporting.

With features such as automated time tracking, real-time attendance data, and detailed reporting, this system is ideal for educational institutions, organizations, and businesses that need an efficient and secure method for managing attendance.

## Features

- Automated Attendance: Employees or students can clock in and out using QR codes, facial recognition, or a mobile app, replacing manual timesheets.
- Real-Time Monitoring: Managers can view live attendance data, track tardiness, and receive alerts for unusual activities.
